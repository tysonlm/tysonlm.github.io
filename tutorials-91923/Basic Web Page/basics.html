        <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
        <p>first we need to learn some basic html</p>
        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site, there are six levels of headings.</p>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an ordered list</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p> 
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strongly</strong>emphasise words or phrases.</p>
        <p>And sometimes you need to <em><strong>shout!</strong></em></p>
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

        <p>Regards,<br/>
