       <p>After the Cubs failed to replicate the 2016 season, decisions had to be made going forward. In 2021, with the trade deadline approaching and much of the Cubs core nearing the end of their contracts, the Cubs elected to trade away most of their best and most popular players. While this was not a popular decision among the fans at the time, this ultimately paid off, as none of the core group have gone on to have large amounts of success since. Today, the Cubs are poised to reenter their competitive window, with young talent on the way and the budget to sign big names.  </p>
