       <p>As someone who was born in 2002, I was poised perfectly to enjoy every minute of the Cubs being good. I was in 7th grade when The Cubs won the World Series, so I have very distinct memories of the Cubs being quite bad before, I remember the run well, and I obviously am very familiar with the events following the World Series win. I have broken my journey through Cubs fandom down into three distinct sections, the pre-2016 issues, 2016, and the post-2016 events. </p>
