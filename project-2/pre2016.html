       <p>Growing up, the Cubs were always “the lovable losers.” Never a contender, always on the bottom. I was too young to remember the last time they were even a little decent, so my childhood was filled with this team that meant a lot to my Dad, but never was any good. I adopted his feelings towards the team without really thinking about it, and realized, when they started to get good, what it really meant to be fully invested in a team. The way all the building blocks fell into place game me a sense of confidence going into 2016, especially after the Cubs beat the Pirates in the wild card  in 2015 </p>
